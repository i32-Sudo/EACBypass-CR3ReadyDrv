# EACBypass-CR3ReadyDrv
This is my EAC Bypass (Setup) Driver that offers an undetected communication and callback handler/hooking system through IOCTL. Its not fully done/made because anything further with Handles & UserMode Hiding is up to the user & if publicized will become blacklisted or detected But I'll list some things you have to do yourself to make this work. This is just an undetected Base you can do to control CR3 & IOCTL Communication with Driver -> Usermode.
# Things to add
- EPROCESS Bypass & DKOM Eprocess Bypass for Usermode.
- CR3 R/W Implementation (Just use my other source)
- Handle ID Randomization for KM->UM Communication
- Get a mapper (Use my DSE Exploit)
